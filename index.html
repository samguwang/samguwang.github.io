                            <p>During my time as an intern at Target, I was assigned on the Stores POC (Proof of Concept) team as a software engineering intern. The project I worked on related to optimal path finding within the stores using new indoor positioning technology. The idea is that Target team members constantly navigate the large stores throughout the day. To look into how they can save time, this app was created to help team members navigate the stores more effeciently. I designed and developed this iOS application using <strong>Swift, XCode, Cocoapods, Github, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and multiple SDKS/APIS.</strong> While concurrently developing the code for the project, I approached the design of the app through user research, wireframing and rapid prototyping through XCode. The application was only to be used by internal team members and was limited to certain stores. I tried to create restraints in options and the usage of signifiers to guide the team members through the application. Ultimately the image above shows the first wireframe I created with the features I've decided to implement. Since I was the sole developer and designer, I didn't feel the need to use anything such as sketch or invision to prototype or wireframe. I was abel to so in XCode and pen and paper.</p>

                            <p> In terms of UI decisions, I decided to keep in line with Target's branding even though the app was a proof of concept project. As I progressed in software development, I made minor changes in my wireframe to accomdate new features. Additionally as development progressed, I did continously took into account my co-worker's opions on the interface and aesthetics of the application.

                            <p>Ultimately, the project allowed me to use both my design and development skills concurrently. My process can be simplified to user research, wireframing, mockups and graphic creation through the adobe suite, rapid prototyping concurrent with code development, and iteration. Below you can find the last iteration of my applicaiton before my internship at Target ended.

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">A simple iOS applicaiton dedicated to helping people decide where to eat.</p>

                            <h3> The Process</h3>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/itadakimasuWire.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Itadakimasu is an iOS application I developed and designed to help people decide where to eat. Many business or food apps provide a plethora of information makign it hard to decide where to eat. Itadakimasu uses Yelp's API to help make that decision easier. Users are prompted with an initial view and a button. Upon pressing the button, a search occurs providing one business for the user to decide on.</p>

                             <p>After pressing the itadakimasu search button, a random business near the user is displayed. A map provides both the user and business locations on apple maps. There is the option of viewing the business on Yelp if more information is desired. If the business is not desireable, the user can search again by pressing the bottom right hand button. This app was developed using <strong>Swift, XCode, Cocoapods, AFNetworking 2.0, Git, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.</strong> </p>

                              <p>I designed itadakimasu through a multistep process combining design and software development. The interface of the application was one of the main reasons for this app's existance. User research was done to find how to convey information in a way that constrains users to decide on where to eat. From the research I gathered on the type of user, the necessary information to display and so on, I drew a quick wireframe showing in general how I wanted the app to look. The icons and graphics were created in Adobe Illustrator where prototyping was done through XCode simultaneously with development. Below are images showing how the app looks as of now. There are more iterations I plan on creating after conducting user tests on the application. </p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">An iOS application created to helping people find out more information on the 2016 Presidential election.</p>

                            <h3>The Process</h3>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/candidacyWire.jpg" alt="">
                             <p>Candidacy is an iOS application that looks to help people find out more information on the 2016 Presidential election. To do so, the application provides news through The New York Times, provides basic Candidate information, provides GoVote information, and lastly provides a new method of polling. Candidacy was developed by a team of three (Kevin Avila, Carlos Andres Rodriguez) including myself. I designed the app alongside contributing the the software development of the app. This app was developed using <strong>Swift, XCode, Cocoapods, Parse, Git, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.</strong></p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/candidacymockup_1.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Our development process began through the design of an app icon alongside a wireframe mockup of the application interface. After brainstorming ideas as a group, I came of up with the initial (fast sketch during brainstorming) wireframe shown above. We took inspiration from snapchat and facebook for certain design elements. The second image shown here is another mockup wireframe a team member created based off of my original. As our team of three wrote code, I continously tried to improve and iterate our design. Below you can see how our most recent version of the application looks.</p>
